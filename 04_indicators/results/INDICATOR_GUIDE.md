## THE BIG PICTURE: Your Edge Lives in Model Selection + Structure

Before diving into indicators, the data shows your **single biggest lever** is which model you trade and the structural context:

| What | Win Rate | Avg R | Verdict |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| EPCH4 (Rejection Secondary) | 60.7% | -- | **Your bread and butter** |
| EPCH3 (Continuation Secondary) | 54.1% | -- | Decent |
| EPCH2 (Rejection Primary) | 48.0% | -- | Below breakeven edge |
| EPCH1 (Continuation Primary) | 39.3% | -- | Avoid or heavily filter |
| SHORT trades | 57.6% | -- | Slight short bias |
| LONG trades | 52.2% | -- | Still profitable |

**Rule #1:** EPCH4 is your edge. EPCH1 is a leak. The indicators below help you filter within each model, but no indicator will save a bad model.

## BEFORE YOU ENTER: The Pre-Entry Checklist

Think of these as conditions to check on the M1 chart in the ~10 minutes before you take a trade at your zone.

### 1. SMA Spread (Most Reliable Pre-Entry Signal)

**What it tells you:** How far apart the fast and slow SMAs are. Wider = stronger trend.

| Condition | What You See | Win Rate | Action |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Spread 0.09-0.18% (Q3) | SMAs clearly separated but not extreme | **61.8%** / 1.63R | **IDEAL -- take the trade** |
| Spread > 0.36% (Q5) | SMAs very wide | 57.8% / 1.00R | OK but lower R |
| Spread < 0.04% (Q1) | SMAs basically flat/touching | 54.9% / 1.00R | Marginal -- needs other confirmation |
| Spread 0.18-0.37% (Q4) | Wide spread | **47.1%** / 1.35R | Caution -- trend may be overstretched |

**In plain English:** You want the SMAs to show a clear trend developing (0.09-0.18% sweet spot), not an exhausted trend that's already extended far. The ramp-up data confirms this -- winners have SMA spread climbing from ~0.21% to ~0.28% in the 25 bars before entry vs. losers stuck at ~0.22%.

### 2. Volume ROC (Volume Rate of Change)

**What it tells you:** Whether volume is spiking or calm relative to recent bars.

| Condition | What You See | Win Rate | Action |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Vol ROC -38% to +5% (Q2-Q3) | Volume is **steady or slightly declining** | **59-60%** / 1.24-1.43R | **IDEAL -- quiet before the move** |
| Vol ROC > 43% (Q5) | Volume is surging/spiking | **47.1%** / 1.13R | **AVOID -- you're late to the party** |

**In plain English:** Counter-intuitively, the best entries happen when volume is NOT spiking. You want to enter during a relative calm. If volume is already surging 40%+, the move may be crowded or exhausting itself. The ramp-up data confirms losers have 2.5x higher Vol ROC than winners in the last 10 bars before entry (277% vs 112%).

### 3. Candle Range % (Volatility of Individual Candles)

**What it tells you:** How big the M1 candles are, as a percentage of price.

| Condition | What You See | Win Rate | Action |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Very small candles < 0.10% (Q1) | Tight, compressed price action | **63.7%** / 1.47R | **BEST -- absorption/consolidation at zone** |
| Large candles > 0.50% (Q5) | Wide, volatile candles | 56.4% / 1.43R | OK if strong momentum |
| Mid-range 0.18-0.28% (Q3) | Neither compressed nor explosive | **47.6%** / 0.82R | **WORST -- choppy, indecisive** |

**In plain English:** The best entries are either (a) tight compression at the zone (absorption -- the market is building energy) or (b) strong momentum candles. The "mushy middle" -- average-sized candles that aren't clearly compressed or clearly moving -- is where losers live. This aligns with the composite data where ABSORPTION candles dominate the top combinations.

### 4. CVD Slope (Cumulative Volume Delta Direction)

**What it tells you:** Whether aggressive buyers or sellers are in control and accelerating.

The ramp-up data shows this is the **clearest divergence signal**: winners have CVD slope climbing from +0.01 to +0.05 (normalized: favorable) in the 25 bars before entry, while losers start negative and barely get to +0.02.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| CVD slope positive and climbing (in your trade direction) | **TAKE IT** -- order flow confirms your direction |
| CVD slope flat near zero | Neutral -- needs other confirmation |
| CVD slope negative (against your direction) | **CAUTION** -- order flow disagrees with your trade |

**However**, note from the quintile data that extreme CVD slopes (Q1 and Q5) at entry both have decent win rates (~58% and ~51%). This suggests CVD slope is more useful as a **ramp-up confirmation** (is it building in your favor?) than as an absolute threshold at entry.

### 5. Vol Delta (5-bar Rolling Volume Delta)

**What it tells you:** Net buying vs selling pressure over the last 5 bars.

The entry quintile data shows a U-shaped pattern -- both strongly negative AND strongly positive vol delta at entry have higher win rates (58-59%) than the middle (47%). This makes sense: strong directional conviction in either direction is good (you're trading both longs and shorts), while wishy-washy middle ground is bad.

**In plain English:** You want to see decisive order flow. If vol delta is strongly in your trade's direction, great. If it's strongly against (and you're fading it with a zone entry), that can work too. What kills you is the indecisive middle.

## STRUCTURAL CONTEXT: The Categorical Indicators

These are the "big picture" conditions visible on higher timeframes.

### M5 Structure -- **Strongest Categorical Edge** (62.5% vs 49.2%)

| Your Trade Direction | M5 Structure | Win Rate | Verdict |
|---------------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Either | BULL | **62.5%** / 1.63R | **Strong edge** |
| Either | BEAR | 49.2% / 0.94R | Weak |

**The catch:** This is raw M5 structure, not direction-aligned. Looking at the deep dive data, most EPCH4 trades (your best model) happen with M5 BEAR across both longs and shorts. This means M5 BULL structure is a filtering tool -- when you see it, confidence goes up.

### H1 Structure -- **Counter-Trend Edge**

| H1 Structure | Win Rate | Avg R | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------|-------|----------------|
| BEAR | **60.4%** | **1.65R** | Best outcomes when H1 is bearish |
| BULL | 50.9% | 0.94R | Lower edge |

**In plain English:** Surprisingly, H1 BEAR structure produces better results. This likely means your zone entries (which are reversion plays at high-volume nodes) work best when the H1 trend is bearish -- you're catching bounces in downtrends or riding short continuation. The composite data backs this up: 7 of the top 10 combos have H1=BEAR.

### M15 Structure

| M15 Structure | Win Rate | Avg R |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| BEAR | **59.9%** | 1.45R |
| BULL | 48.4% | 0.95R |

Same pattern as H1 -- bearish M15 structure produces better zone trades. Your system appears to have a structural edge in bearish environments.

### SMA Configuration

| SMA Config | Win Rate | Avg R |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| BULL | **61.1%** | 1.35R |
| BEAR | 47.3% | 1.08R |

This seems contradictory to H1/M15 -- BULL SMA config wins more. But it makes sense: **BULL SMA** (fast above slow) combined with **BEAR structure** (H1/M15 making lower highs) = a classic mean-reversion setup. The SMAs show local bullish momentum within a bearish structural context.

### Price Position

| Position | Win Rate | Avg R |
|---------|----------|-------|
| ABOVE SMA | **58.6%** | **1.47R** |
| BETWEEN | 59.9% | 1.32R |
| BELOW SMA | **46.6%** | 0.84R |

**Avoid trades where price is below the SMAs.** Above or between is where your edge lives.

## THE IDEAL SETUP (What the Data Says to Look For)

Based on the composite analysis, here are the **top proven combinations**:

### A-Grade Setups (65%+ Win Rate, 20+ trades)
1. **BEAR SMA + BEAR H1 + BULL M15 + Normal Vol + Absorption candles** -> 80% WR, 2.16R (25 trades)
2. **BULL SMA + BULL H1 + BULL M15 + Normal Vol + Absorption candles** -> 77.8% WR, 2.48R (27 trades)
3. **BULL SMA + BEAR H1 + BEAR M15 + Normal Vol + Normal candles** -> 73.3% WR, 1.93R (75 trades)

### The Pattern in the Winners:
- **Normal volume** (not elevated) -- don't chase spikes
- **Absorption candles** (very tight) or **Normal candles** -- never "Low" candles
- **BEAR H1** appears in 7 of the top 10 combos
- **BULL SMA** appears in 6 of the top 10 combos

### AVOID These (Under 35% Win Rate)
1. **BEAR SMA + BULL H1 + BULL M15 + Normal Vol + Normal candles** -> 27.0% WR (89 trades!) -- **major sample, major loss zone**
2. **BEAR SMA + BEAR H1 + BULL M15 + Elevated Vol + Normal candles** -> 11.8% WR (34 trades) -- **worst combo in the dataset**
3. **BEAR SMA + BULL H1 + BULL M15 + Elevated Vol + Normal candles** -> 31.0% WR (29 trades)

### The Pattern in the Losers:
- **BEAR SMA + BULL H1** is toxic -- this combination appears in all 3 worst performers
- **Elevated volume** in a bullish structural context kills your edge
- **BULL M15 + BULL H1** with BEAR SMA = structural disagreement -> avoid

## AFTER ENTRY: Early Warning Signs

The post-trade data tells you when a trade is working or failing:

### Within 1-2 Bars After Entry:
- **Winners:** Vol Delta immediately goes strongly positive (favorable). By bar 1, winners show +66,871 normalized vol delta.
- **Losers:** Vol Delta immediately goes negative (unfavorable). By bar 1, losers show -27,131.
- **Gap:** 114,000+ delta difference by bar 5. This is the **strongest early signal**.

### CVD Slope After Entry:
- **Winners:** CVD slope jumps from +0.05 (ramp-up) to +0.064 at entry, then climbs to +0.11 by bar 5
- **Losers:** CVD slope drops from +0.02 to +0.019 at entry, then goes negative by bar 3

### Practical Rule:
> If order flow (vol delta) hasn't turned favorable within 2-3 bars of entry, the trade is more likely to be a loser. Consider tightening your stop or reducing size.

## QUICK REFERENCE: Pre-Entry Decision Tree

```
1. Is this EPCH4 or EPCH3?
   YES -> Continue (your edge models)
   NO (EPCH1/2) -> Need VERY strong indicator confirmation to proceed

2. Check H1 Structure
   BEAR -> Good (+60.4% WR, +1.65R)
   BULL -> Need other indicators to be strong

3. Check SMA Config
   BULL (fast > slow) -> Good (+61.1% WR)
   BEAR -> Only if H1 is also BEAR (BEAR+BEAR = 66.7%)
   BEAR SMA + BULL H1 -> AVOID (worst combo)

4. Check Price Position
   ABOVE or BETWEEN -> Proceed
   BELOW -> Skip trade (46.6% WR, 0.84R)

5. Check Candle Range at Zone
   Tight/Absorption (< 0.10%) -> BEST entries (63.7%)
   Normal -> Fine
   Mid-range mushy (0.18-0.28%) -> Weak (47.6%)

6. Check Vol ROC
   Steady/declining (< 5%) -> BEST (60% WR)
   Elevated (> 43%) -> AVOID (47.1%)

7. Check CVD Slope (last few M1 bars)
   Building in your direction -> Confirmation
   Flat or against -> Lower confidence

8. ENTER if 4+ of the above are favorable
```

## WHAT THE SETUP SCORE TELLS US

The composite setup score (0-7) shows a non-linear pattern:

| Score | Win Rate | Avg R | Take? |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| 0 | 54.5% | 1.24 | Meh -- no conditions met but still profitable |
| **1** | **65.1%** | **1.38** | **Sweet spot -- one strong condition** |
| 2 | 53.6% | 1.21 | Average |
| **3** | **59.0%** | **1.43** | **Second sweet spot** |
| 4 | 47.3% | 1.00 | Below baseline |
| 5 | 50.0% | 0.92 | Breakeven |
| 6 | 46.7% | 1.47 | Small sample (15), unreliable |

**The surprise:** More conditions met does not equal better. Scores of 1 and 3 are the sweet spots. Scores of 4-6 actually perform WORSE. This suggests that when too many "favorable" conditions align, the trade may be too obvious/crowded, or the thresholds need recalibrating. Focus on having a **few strong confirmations** rather than checking every box.

## SUMMARY: Three Rules to Live By

1. **Trade EPCH4 in bearish H1 structure with BULL SMA config and price above the SMAs.** This is your highest-conviction setup. Don't fight it by adding complexity.

2. **Enter on compression (absorption candles) with normal/quiet volume.** The best zone entries happen when price is quietly coiling at the level, not when it's already exploding through it.

3. **Confirm with CVD slope building in your direction.** If order flow isn't accelerating your way in the 5-10 bars before entry, the zone is less likely to hold. And if vol delta doesn't turn favorable within 2 bars of entry, manage risk aggressively.
